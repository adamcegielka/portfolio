### About me
Testing, detecting bugs and their causes, has been a passion of mine for a long time. In order to develop these abilities, I decided to take an intensive "Software Tester" course. According to the results of the Thomas PPA test, I am a thorough person who pays a lot of attention to detail, which makes me excel in my new role.
